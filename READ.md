# Dungeon Bud

**Description**

This was a project aimed at learning how to parse data from csv files. I decided to do this by recreating the LA Times coronavirus tracking page. Using csv files from the LA Times github, I parsed out latest COVID-19 data for California and displayed that data in a similar way.
